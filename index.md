### Peace Party

### Constitution:
the party shall be led by a "peoples council" made up of 3 people elected by simple majority, they may be recalled instantly if a majority of the party votes to do so

any major decisions such as changes to party platform, constitution, name, logo, or expulsion of member if controversial, can only be changed via party wide referendum

### Platform:

Non Interventionism: The peace party advocates for peace among nations, it is against declaring war unless the US or its allies have been attacked or had war declared upon them first

Internationalism: The Peace Party is not an isolationist party, diplomacy is to be built on kindness, respect, and mutual benefit. It is not against diplomatic relations with anyone.

Economics: The Peace Party is a workers party, it fights for workers, this includes poverty reduction, social programs, nationalization if necessary, progressive taxation, and anything else meant to improve the living conditions of the masses.

Social Issues: The Peace Party is for peace domestically, not just among nations. All people regardless of gender identity or race should be equal and treated with respect. the peace party supports LGBTQIA+, feminism, and any other progressive movement.
