### Platform:
Non Interventionism: 

- The peace party advocates for peace among nations, it is against declaring war unless the US or its allies have been attacked or had war declared upon them first

-  The U.S. must recognize the sovereignty of nation-states and their right of self-determination. 

-  The Peace Party urges our government to sign the International Criminal Court agreement and respect the authority of that institution to ensure compliance with international laws and to discourage war crimes. 

- The Peace Party's nuclear policies are as follows:
  - Declare a no-first-strike policy. 
  - Declare a no-pre-emptive strike policy. 
  - Declare that the U.S. will never threaten or use a nuclear weapon, regardless of size, on a non-nuclear nation. 
  - Sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Our pledge to end testing will open the way for non-nuclear states to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which has been held up by our refusal to sign the CTBT. Honor the conditions set in the NPT for nuclear nations. 
  - Reverse our withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and honor its stipulations. 
  - End the research, testing and stockpiling of all nuclear weapons of any size. 
  - Dismantle all nuclear warheads from their missiles.

-  The Peace Party urges the government to sign the Toronto treaty banning the production, stockpiling, use and sale of land mines, and assist other nations in unearthing and disabling land mines buried in their lands. 

-  We urge our government to end all stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons and all research, use, and sale of such weapons; and sign the convention that will establish the decrease and inspection of all nations' stockpiles of such weapons, which the U.S. abandoned. 
-  The U.S. must prohibit all covert actions used to influence, de-stabilize or usurp the governments of other nations, and likewise prohibit the assassination of, or assistance in any form for the assassination of, foreign government officials. 


Internationalism: The Peace Party is not an isolationist party, diplomacy is to be built on kindness, respect, and mutual benefit. It is not against diplomatic relations with anyone.

Economics: 

Expropriation without any compensation of the capitalist class, namely the banks, big corporations and communication networks; nationalization of property and movable property wealth, of lands, the subsoil and water resources

Cancellation of loans, household loans and all other types of loans owned to banks, the state and the capitalist class. Cancellation of loans and credits incurred from other countries. Immediate dissolution of investment funds and risk capital, including those of the trade unions; safeguarding of savings, pensions and all other means of subsistence earned by the workers.

Constant and progressive reduction of salary gaps until their complete elimination, be it between manual labourers and intellectuals, men and women, leaders and those who are under their leadership, between the more educated or more qualified and others who have less, between cities and the countryside.

Social Issues: The Peace Party is for peace domestically, not just among nations. All people regardless of gender identity or race should be equal and treated with respect. the peace party supports LGBTQIA+, feminism, and any other progressive movement.
