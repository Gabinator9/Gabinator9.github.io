### PEACE PARTY

### Constitution:
the party shall be led by a "peoples council" made up of 3 people elected by simple majority, they may be recalled instantly if a majority of the party votes to do so

any major decisions such as changes to party platform, constitution, name, logo, or expulsion of member if controversial, can only be changed via party wide referendum

### Platform:
Non Interventionism: 

- The peace party advocates for peace among nations, it is against declaring war unless the US or its allies have been attacked or had war declared upon them first

-  The U.S. must recognize the sovereignty of nation-states and their right of self-determination. 

-  The Peace Party urges our government to sign the International Criminal Court agreement and respect the authority of that institution to ensure compliance with international laws and to discourage war crimes. 

- The Peace Party's nuclear policies are as follows:
  - Declare a no-first-strike policy. 
  - Declare a no-pre-emptive strike policy. 
  - Declare that the U.S. will never threaten or use a nuclear weapon, regardless of size, on a non-nuclear nation. 
  - Sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Our pledge to end testing will open the way for non-nuclear states to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which has been held up by our refusal to sign the CTBT. Honor the conditions set in the NPT for nuclear nations. 
  - Reverse our withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and honor its stipulations. 
  - End the research, testing and stockpiling of all nuclear weapons of any size. 
  - Dismantle all nuclear warheads from their missiles.

-  The Peace Party urges the government to sign the Toronto treaty banning the production, stockpiling, use and sale of land mines, and assist other nations in unearthing and disabling land mines buried in their lands. 

-  We urge our government to end all stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons and all research, use, and sale of such weapons; and sign the convention that will establish the decrease and inspection of all nations' stockpiles of such weapons, which the U.S. abandoned. 
-  The U.S. must prohibit all covert actions used to influence, de-stabilize or usurp the governments of other nations, and likewise prohibit the assassination of, or assistance in any form for the assassination of, foreign government officials. 


Internationalism: The Peace Party is not an isolationist party, diplomacy is to be built on kindness, respect, and mutual benefit. It is not against diplomatic relations with anyone.

Economics: The Peace Party is a workers party, it fights for workers, this includes poverty reduction, social programs, nationalization if necessary, progressive taxation, and anything else meant to improve the living conditions of the masses.

Social Issues: The Peace Party is for peace domestically, not just among nations. All people regardless of gender identity or race should be equal and treated with respect. the peace party supports LGBTQIA+, feminism, and any other progressive movement.
